# Learning RxJS

I am learning RxJS by going through the [documentation](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/guide/overview) and using it as a set of exercises.

## Getting started

```sh
npm install
node server.js
ts-node src/creationOperators.ts # Use the if statements to switch the on/off each section.
```
